Draw Your Data
--------------

Visualizing data is a powerful way to discover meaning. Current methods are
lackluster because none allow for both direct manipulation of visuals and dynamic
loading of data. Drawing by hand is direct but means a new drawing for every set
of data. Writing code creates dynamic visuals but requires programming
knowledge and blind manipulation of symbols. Draw Your Data gives you a guided
canvas to draw your data into - directly, dynamically, simply.
